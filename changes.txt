1. We added an Observable interface, and made the StockExchange interface extend from it

2. Add AbstractTraderBuilder, DefaultTraderBuilder, RandomTraderBuilder
   Used when constructing traders. In demo, simplifies constructing random traders as only name + random are changed during loop, other fields are set once.

3. Add a StockExchangeOrderView interface. Create StockExchangeOrderProxy class.
   Proxy is created which implements order view interface, this is sent to traders. Traders no longer have access to anything not related to orders.
